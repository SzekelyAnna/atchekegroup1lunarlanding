        "In a standard RL setting, an agent learns optimal behavior from an environment through a feedback mechanism to maximize a given objective. Many algorithms have been proposed in the RL literature that an agent can apply to learn the optimal behavior. One such popular algorithm is the Deep Q-Network (DQN). This algorithm makes use of deep neural networks to compute optimal actions. In this project, your goal is to understand the effect of the number of neural network layers on the algorithm's performance. The performance of the algorithm can be evaluated through two metrics - Speed and Stability. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Speed:** How fast the algorithm reaches the maximum possible reward. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Stability** In some applications (especially when online learning is involved), along with speed, stability of the algorithm, i.e., minimal fluctuations in performance, is equally important. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, you should investigate the following question:\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is the impact of number of neural network layers on speed and stability of the algorithm?**\n",
        "\n",
        "You do not have to write the DQN code from scratch. We have provided a basic implementation of the DQN algorithm. You only have to tune the hyperparameters (neural network size, learning rate, etc), observe the performance, and analyze. More details on this are provided below. \n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let us discuss the RL task we have chosen, i.e., Lunar Lander. This task consists of the lander and a landing pad marked by two flags. The episode starts with the lander moving downwards due to gravity. The objective is to land safely using different engines available on the lander with zero speed on the landing pad as quickly and fuel efficient as possible. Reward for moving from the top of the screen and landing on landing pad with zero speed is between 100 to 140 points. Each leg ground contact yields a reward of 10 points. Firing main engine leads to a reward of -0.3 points in each frame. Firing the side engine leads to a reward of -0.03 points in each frame. An additional reward of -100 or +100 points is received if the lander crashes or comes to rest respectively which also leads to end of the episode. \n",
